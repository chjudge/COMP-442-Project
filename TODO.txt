1. Make Update Profile Work
2. Account Settings page (different from profile, enables email change)

Things to do for GroverMingle:
-make sure admin and the current user are not displayed
on the profile page
-create a filter by gender (and then others if easy)
	- i am going to implement by adding a prefences page that
	can be changed and will be applied to everything automatically
-implement a chat feature using a database
	- will say if read or not in database
	- reply will add a message to the other's db
-polish profile view by implementing another db table that stores
tuples of likes a dislikes
-add profile image support
	-this must be implemented across the board

Current:
-fix profile page image view
-fix error message flashing for age and pfp (done)
-make it so the create preferences button does not appear upon initial setup
